This is a satirical NFT site, where I gathered drawings from my friends to "sell". This was a fullstack project because I combined React, NextJS, and Sanity. You can see products sorted by their tags and add things to your cart. Honestly, I think this could be a really fun idea if we were to develop it further and involve more of the UPenn student community.

I covered:
- frontend: components, animations, mobile responsiveness
- Backend: API calls, integration with database
- Fullstack: linked React with NextJS and Sanity
- Misc: product sorting system, cart buying system

( i didnt have time to finish reg/login/logout pls don't hold this against me ;-; )

At the beginning I had a lot of issues because the tutorial I was referencing was for a different version of NextJS or something
so while setting up the project there were a ton of errors. Also even on the official websites their syntax was WRONG I had to piece
together advice from different posts on stack overflow and at that point I was just randomly trying anything I could in despiration.

Thats why this github project is named ECommerce4, I started from scratch to try to fix the errors four times LOL. 
So yeah I'm persistient and determined and stubborn to keep on trying until things work out! ( or im just dumb :P ) 

That took me like 2 days to completely iron out. Then after that it was mostly smoother sailing, I spent around 4-2 hours per day 
on this project during the rest of the week (this includes the time I spent trying to learn what the code meant through various resources, not just the code typing time itself)

TLDR I spent a lot longer on this project than I origionally intended to because I got really into it ^u^

I didn't deploy my site because I didn't finish the reg/login/logout and I'm a perfectionist so heres a google drive link:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
