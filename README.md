This is a satirical NFT site, where I gathered drawings from my friends to "sell". This was a fullstack project because I combined React, NextJS, and Sanity. You can see products sorted by their tags and add things to your cart. Honestly, I think this could be a really fun idea if we were to develop it further and involve more of the UPenn student community.

I covered:
- frontend: components, animations, mobile responsiveness
- Backend: API calls, integration with database
- Fullstack: linked React with NextJS and Sanity
- Misc: product sorting system, cart buying system

( i didnt have time to finish reg/login/logout pls don't hold this against me ;-; )

At the beginning I had a lot of issues because the tutorial I was referencing was for a different version of NextJS or something
so while setting up the project there were a ton of errors. Also even on the official websites their syntax was WRONG I had to piece
together advice from different posts on stack overflow and at that point I was just randomly trying anything I could in despiration.

Thats why this github project is named ECommerce4, I started from scratch to try to fix the errors four times LOL. 
So yeah I'm persistient and determined and stubborn to keep on trying until things work out! ( or im just dumb :P ) 

That took me like 2 days to completely iron out. Then after that it was mostly smoother sailing, I spent around 4-2 hours per day 
on this project during the rest of the week (this includes the time I spent trying to learn what the code meant through various resources, not just the code typing time itself)

TLDR I spent a lot longer on this project than I origionally intended to because I got really into it ^u^

I didn't deploy my site because I didn't finish the reg/login/logout and I'm a perfectionist so heres a google drive link:
