This is a satirical NFT site, where I gathered drawings from my friends to "sell". This was a fullstack project because I combined React, NextJS, and Sanity. You can see products sorted by their tags and add things to your cart. Honestly, I think this could be a really fun idea if we were to develop it further and involve more of the UPenn student community.

I covered:
- frontend: components, animations, mobile responsiveness
- Backend: API calls, integration with database
- Fullstack: linked React with NextJS and Sanity
- Misc: product sorting system, cart buying system

( i didnt have time to finish reg/login/logout pls don't hold this against me ;-; )

I had a lot of issues starting out because Sanity's official syntax guide was wrong! 
I had to piece together advice from stackoverflow posts and restarted 4 times (thus the name ECommerce4). 
My stubbornness to keep on trying until things work out is what pulled me through.

I didn't deploy my site because I didn't finish the reg/login/logout and I'm a perfectionist so heres a google drive link:
